Superpositional Church:

1. A church founded as an open-source legal shelter for all possible rights for vulnerable populations.
2. In the United States, religious freedom is an iron-clad way to protect rights.
3. A church can be filed with all existing protections - and then updated quickly via internet.
No ceremony, congregation, building or etc. is needed.

0. Quite obviously, there are rights that do not exist yet, and this Github
codebase will be used to intake the additions as quickly as possible.
